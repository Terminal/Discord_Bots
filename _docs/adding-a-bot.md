# Adding your bot to the website
Thanks for choosing Discord_Fork for your preffered Discord Bots Service Provider (DBSP)

## From GitHub
You will require some knowledge on `git` in order to add your bot.

### 1. Fork the project

![How to fork](/assets/images/adding-a-bot/1531011733.77.png)

### 2. Create a file
- Inside the `_bots` folder, create a file called `[CLIENT_ID].md`, where `[CLIENT_ID]` is the ID of your bot.
- Copy the code below, and replace with your own details
- If you do not have a GitHub repository, **DO NOT** insert the following
  - ```
    github:
      owner: N/A
      repo: N/A
    ```
  - This is not allowed, and is grounds for deletion
  - Creating a GitHub repository is recommended, as it increases your ranking on the homepage.
    - Read more about rankings [here](/docs/ranking);
- Optional fields are OPTIONAL. **DO NOT** insert `N/A` when you have nothing to insert.
  - This is also not allowed, and is grounds for deletion.
